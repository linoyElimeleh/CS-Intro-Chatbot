To compile a package from the shell (terminal / command com), 
follow these steps: 

-1. Don't change the given folder structure.
 0. Note that the TestList class begins with the statement
    "import lists.*".
 1. Compile the TestList.java file. This will automatically compile
    all the classes in the lists folder.

That's it. If you will try to compile the classes in the lists
folder in any other way (in the shell), you will get compilation errors.

If you make changes in any one of the .java files in the lists
folder, you must repeat step 1: recompile the TestList.java class
(even if you did not change it). This action will recompile all the
files in the lists folder, including the one that you changed.
